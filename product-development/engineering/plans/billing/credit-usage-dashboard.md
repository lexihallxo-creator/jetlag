## Overview
Show users a breakdown of how they're spending credits (generations, edits, deploys) so they understand consumption before hitting limits or deciding to upgrade.

## Steps
1. Add `GET /api/billing/usage` endpoint in `src/routes/billing.ts`
   - Query credit transactions grouped by type and day
   - Return current balance, burn rate, projected days remaining
2. Create `UsageDashboard` component in `src/components/billing/`
   - Bar chart showing daily credit usage by category
   - Summary cards: credits used this cycle, remaining, reset date
   - Trend line showing consumption rate
3. Add usage breakdown by project
   - `GET /api/billing/usage/by-project` returns per-project totals
   - Sortable table: project name, generations, edits, total credits
4. Add low-balance warning banner
   - Show at <20% remaining credits on home page
   - Link to upgrade or purchase more credits
5. Add tests
   - Usage totals match actual credit transactions
   - Breakdown by project sums to total
   - Warning banner appears at correct threshold
