## Objective
Investigate reports of users being charged credits twice for a single AI generation when the request times out and the client retries automatically.

## Background
Support received 12 tickets in 3 days from users reporting unexpected credit depletion. Pattern analysis showed all affected users experienced at least one generation timeout during the reporting period. The generation retry logic was added in v2.4.0 to improve reliability.

## Impact Scope
- **Affected users:** ~340 users who experienced generation timeouts since v2.4.0 (2026-03-01)
- **Credits over-deducted:** ~4,800 credits total across affected users
- **Severity:** P1 — financial impact, users charged for work not delivered
- **Duration:** 2026-03-01 to 2026-03-12 (11 days)

## Infrastructure
- **Service:** `generation-service` (Node.js on Vercel serverless)
- **Billing service:** `credit-ledger` microservice (Supabase Edge Function)
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL — `credit_transactions` and `generation_jobs` tables
- **Queue:** Inngest for async generation job processing
- **Client:** React frontend with axios retry interceptor

## Results
- The axios retry interceptor on the client fires a new `POST /api/generate` on timeout
- The original request is still processing server-side (Vercel hasn't killed it yet)
- Both requests reach `credit-ledger` and deduct credits independently
- The generation deduplication check uses `generation_id`, but retries generate a new ID on the client

## Analysis
1. Traced Datadog requests — found paired requests 30-60s apart with same user, same prompt, different `generation_id`
2. Checked `credit_transactions` — both requests created separate debit entries
3. Reviewed client retry logic (PR #501) — axios interceptor generates fresh `generation_id` per attempt
4. Checked server-side — no idempotency key or dedup mechanism on the billing endpoint
5. Confirmed the original request often completes successfully after the timeout, so user gets charged twice but only sees one result

## Root Cause
The client-side retry interceptor generates a new `generation_id` for each attempt, bypassing the server's deduplication check which relies on `generation_id` uniqueness. When the original request completes after the timeout, both the original and retry are billed independently. There is no idempotency key tying retries to the original request.

## Recommended Fix
1. Generate a `request_idempotency_key` on the client before the first attempt, reuse across retries
2. Add idempotency check in `credit-ledger`: if a debit with the same key exists within 5 minutes, skip
3. Refund over-charged credits for the 340 affected users (automated script)
4. Add server-side abort: if a generation is already in progress for the same prompt + user, return the existing job ID instead of starting a new one

## Cross-Validation
- Matched double-charge events in `credit_transactions` with timeout logs in Datadog (100% correlation)
- Verified fix in staging: retry with same idempotency key correctly deduplicates
- Confirmed refund calculation matches support ticket reports for 5 sampled users

## Data Examples

| User ID | Date | Credits Charged | Expected | Over-charge |
|---------|------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| usr_p4k2 | 2026-03-10 | 40 | 20 | 20 |
| usr_h7m1 | 2026-03-08 | 60 | 20 | 40 |
| usr_r2n8 | 2026-03-11 | 40 | 20 | 20 |
| usr_w5j3 | 2026-03-09 | 80 | 40 | 40 |

## Executive Summary
Users are double-charged when generation requests time out and retry. The client retry logic creates a new generation ID per attempt, so the server treats retries as separate billable requests. Fix by adding an idempotency key that persists across retries, and refund ~4,800 over-charged credits to 340 affected users. This is a P1 billing issue — ship the fix immediately and run the refund script.

## Appendix

### Query 1: Find double-charged users
```sql
SELECT ct.user_id, COUNT(*) as charge_count, SUM(ct.amount) as total_charged
FROM credit_transactions ct
JOIN generation_jobs gj ON gj.id = ct.reference_id
WHERE ct.type = 'debit'
  AND ct.created_at > '2026-03-01'
GROUP BY ct.user_id, gj.prompt_hash, DATE_TRUNC('minute', ct.created_at)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY total_charged DESC;
```

### Query 2: Calculate refund amounts per user
```sql
WITH duplicates AS (
  SELECT ct.user_id, ct.amount,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ct.user_id, gj.prompt_hash, DATE_TRUNC('minute', ct.created_at) ORDER BY ct.created_at) as rn
  FROM credit_transactions ct
  JOIN generation_jobs gj ON gj.id = ct.reference_id
  WHERE ct.type = 'debit' AND ct.created_at > '2026-03-01'
)
SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) as refund_amount
FROM duplicates
WHERE rn > 1
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY refund_amount DESC;
```

### Query 3: Verify retry pattern in generation jobs
```sql
SELECT gj.user_id, gj.prompt_hash, gj.created_at, gj.status, gj.generation_id
FROM generation_jobs gj
WHERE gj.user_id = $1
  AND gj.created_at > '2026-03-01'
ORDER BY gj.created_at;
```
