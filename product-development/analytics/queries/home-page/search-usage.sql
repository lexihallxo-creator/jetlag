-- Search Usage Metrics
-- Calculates daily search usage rate, zero-results rate, and average results
-- per query from the search_events table.
-- Used in the Search Health dashboard (Sigma).
--
-- Usage rate = distinct searchers / DAU
-- Zero-results rate = searches with 0 results / total searches
-- Avg results = mean result_count across all searches
