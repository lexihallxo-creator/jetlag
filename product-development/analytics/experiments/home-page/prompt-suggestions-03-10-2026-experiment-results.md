## TL;DR

Personalized prompt suggestions on the Forge home page increased prompt submission rate by 18% (32.1% vs 27.2%) and reduced median time-to-first-action by 11 seconds. The treatment group also showed a 6% lift in Day 7 retention. Recommendation: **Ship to 100% of users.**

---

## Hypothesis

Users who see prompt suggestions based on their project history and usage patterns will engage with the home page prompt input at a higher rate than users who see generic starter prompts, because personalized suggestions reduce the cognitive load of deciding what to build next.

## Control: Generic Prompt Suggestions

Users in the control group saw a fixed set of 4 generic starter prompts displayed below the home page prompt input:

| Prompt |
|--------|
| "Build a landing page for my startup" |
| "Create a SaaS dashboard with analytics" |
| "Design a portfolio website" |
| "Make an e-commerce product page" |

These prompts were static, identical for all users, and did not change between sessions.

## Treatment: Personalized Prompt Suggestions

Users in the treatment group saw up to 4 dynamically generated prompt suggestions based on:

1. **Recent project context:** Suggestions related to the user's last 3 projects (e.g., if the user recently built a dashboard, suggest "Add a settings page to your dashboard").
2. **Framework affinity:** Suggestions matching the user's most-used framework (e.g., Next.js users see Next.js-specific prompts).
3. **Progression signals:** For users who have generated but not deployed, suggest deployment-oriented prompts. For users who deployed, suggest iteration prompts.
4. **Fallback:** New users with no history received the same generic prompts as the control group.

Suggestions refreshed on each home page visit, with a maximum of 1 repeat suggestion across consecutive visits.

## Results

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Delta | p-value | Significant |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Prompt submission rate | 27.2% | 32.1% | +18.0% | 0.003 | Yes |
| Time-to-first-action (median) | 48s | 37s | -22.9% | 0.001 | Yes |
| Home page bounce rate | 41.3% | 38.7% | -6.3% | 0.042 | Yes |

### Secondary Metrics

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Delta | p-value | Significant |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Suggestions clicked (% of impressions) | 14.8% | 22.6% | +52.7% | < 0.001 | Yes |
| Generations per session | 1.8 | 2.1 | +16.7% | 0.018 | Yes |
| Day 7 retention | 43.2% | 45.8% | +6.0% | 0.087 | No (marginal) |
| Deploy rate (within session) | 18.4% | 19.1% | +3.8% | 0.312 | No |
| Avg generation quality score | 7.2 | 7.3 | +1.4% | 0.624 | No |

### Segmentation

| Segment | Control Submission Rate | Treatment Submission Rate | Delta |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Free tier | 24.1% | 28.9% | +19.9% |
| Pro tier | 30.8% | 35.4% | +14.9% |
| Teams tier | 32.5% | 38.2% | +17.5% |
| New users (< 7 days) | 21.3% | 27.0% | +26.8% |
| Returning users (7+ days) | 31.4% | 35.6% | +13.4% |

The largest lift was observed in new users (< 7 days old), where personalized suggestions increased submission rate by 26.8%. This is partially explained by the fact that new users benefit most from guided prompts since they have less familiarity with what Forge can build.

## Learnings

1. **Personalization outperforms generic across all segments.** The lift was consistent across tiers and tenure, though strongest for new users. This validates the hypothesis that reducing cognitive load drives engagement.

2. **Framework affinity is the strongest signal.** Among the three personalization signals (recent projects, framework affinity, progression), framework-matched suggestions had the highest click rate (28.3% vs 19.1% for recent-project and 17.4% for progression-based suggestions).

3. **Time-to-first-action is a leading indicator.** The 11-second reduction in median time-to-first-action correlated with higher downstream generation counts. Users who act faster tend to iterate more within the same session.

4. **Deploy rate was not significantly affected.** Personalized suggestions increased generation engagement but did not meaningfully move deployment rates within the same session. Deployment is a downstream behavior with its own friction points unrelated to prompt suggestions.

5. **Day 7 retention showed a promising but non-significant signal.** The 6% lift (p=0.087) warrants monitoring post-launch. A longer observation window or larger sample may confirm this trend.

## Decision

**Ship to 100% of users.** The primary metrics showed statistically significant improvements with no degradation in guardrail metrics (generation quality, error rates, page load time). The feature flag `personalized_prompt_suggestions` will be set to `enabled` for all users starting 2026-03-12.

Follow-up work:
- Monitor Day 7 retention for 4 weeks post-launch to validate the marginal retention signal.
- Explore adding a 4th personalization signal based on template browsing history (FORGE-1062).
- A/B test suggestion count: 4 vs 6 suggestions to determine if more options improve or hurt engagement.
