# Primary Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|

| Time-to-live | Median elapsed time from domain added (`created_at`) to first request served on the custom domain | < 10 min | `custom_domains.created_at` to first `domain_request_events.timestamp` |

# Secondary Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| SSL provision success rate | % of DNS-verified domains that successfully receive an SSL certificate on the first attempt | > 99% | `domain_certificates` where `status = 'active'` / total DNS-verified domains |
| Renewal success rate | % of auto-renewal attempts that succeed without manual intervention | > 99.5% | `domain_certificates` where renewal attempted and `status` remained `active` |
| DNS verification success rate | % of added domains that reach `dns_status = 'verified'` within 48 hours | > 80% | `custom_domains` where `dns_status = 'verified'` / total created |
| DNS verification time | Median time from domain added to DNS verified | < 30 min | `custom_domains.created_at` to timestamp of `dns_status = 'verified'` transition |
| Free-to-Pro conversion lift | Relative increase in Free-to-Pro conversion among users who encounter the custom domain upgrade CTA | +15% | `custom_domain_events` joined with `subscriptions` |
| Domain removal rate | % of custom domains removed within 30 days of being added | < 10% | `custom_domains` where deleted within 30 days of `created_at` |
