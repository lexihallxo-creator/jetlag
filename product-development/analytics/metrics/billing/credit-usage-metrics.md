## Primary Metrics

### Credit Utilization Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of allocated credits used within a billing cycle.

```
credit_utilization_rate = (total_credits_debited_in_cycle / cycle_credit_allocation) * 100
```

**Segmentation**: Calculated per user and aggregated by subscription tier (Free, Pro, Team, Business, Enterprise).

**Target**: This is a tracking metric rather than an optimization target. The goal is to understand distribution:
- Users below 30% utilization may be over-provisioned (downgrade risk or engagement problem).
- Users above 80% utilization are candidates for proactive upgrade outreach.
- Users at 100% who did not upgrade are the highest churn risk.

**Current distribution (March 2026)**:
| Tier | Median Utilization | % Users >80% | % Users at 100% |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Free | 72% | 38% | 22% |
| Pro | 61% | 24% | 11% |
| Team | 54% | 18% | 7% |

**Refresh cadence**: Daily, computed in the `dbt_billing.credit_utilization` model.

### Credit-to-Upgrade Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of users who upgrade their subscription within 7 days of their credit balance dropping below 20% of their cycle allocation.

```
credit_to_upgrade_rate = (users_who_upgraded_within_7d_of_low_balance / users_who_hit_low_balance) * 100
```

**Target**: >12% (current baseline: 8%).

**Rationale**: This metric directly measures whether credit usage visibility translates into self-serve upgrades. The 7-day window accounts for the typical decision-making period observed in user behavior data. The 20% threshold aligns with the low-balance warning banner trigger.

**Refresh cadence**: Weekly, computed in the `dbt_billing.credit_upgrade_funnel` model.

## Secondary Metrics

### Average Credits per Generation

**Definition**: Mean number of credits consumed per generation event, segmented by generation type (text-to-UI, image-to-UI, iteration).

```
avg_credits_per_generation = SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT reference_id)
WHERE category = 'generation' AND type = 'debit'
```

**Current values (March 2026)**:
| Generation Type | Avg Credits |
|----------------|-------------|
| Text-to-UI | 12.4 |
| Image-to-UI | 18.7 |
| Iteration | 6.2 |

**Use case**: Informs credit pricing decisions and helps users understand relative costs across generation types.

### Credit Depletion Rate by Tier

**Definition**: Percentage of users who reach 0 credits before their billing cycle resets, segmented by subscription tier.

```
depletion_rate = (users_reaching_zero_balance / total_users_in_tier) * 100
```

**Current values (March 2026)**:
| Tier | Depletion Rate |
|------|---------------|
| Free | 22% |
| Pro | 11% |
| Team | 7% |
| Business | 3% |

**Target**: Reduce Free and Pro depletion rates by 30% relative through proactive warnings (not by increasing allocations).

---

### Refund Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of total credit debits that are subsequently refunded within the same billing cycle.

```
refund_rate = (SUM(amount WHERE category = 'refund') / SUM(amount WHERE type = 'debit')) * 100
```

**Current value**: 2.1% (March 2026).

**Target**: <3%. A refund rate above 3% may indicate generation quality issues driving user dissatisfaction and manual refund requests.
