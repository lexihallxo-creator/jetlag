# Forge Platform Overview

High-level architecture and system overview for the Forge platform.

# What Forge Does

Forge is an AI-powered platform that turns natural language prompts into deployable web applications. Users describe what they want to build, Forge generates the code, and with one click they can deploy it to a live URL.

# Core Systems

## AI Generation Engine
The generation engine is the core of Forge. It takes a user's natural language prompt, processes it through a fine-tuned LLM pipeline, and produces a complete, working web application.

- **Prompt processing:** Analyzes and enriches user prompts with context from their project history and selected templates
- **Code generation:** Multi-step generation pipeline that produces frontend (React), backend (Node.js/Python), and infrastructure configuration
- **Quality checks:** Automated linting, build verification, and visual regression checks before presenting output to the user
- **Model versions:** Currently on `forge-gen-3.2`, with model upgrades managed through a staged rollout process

## Deployment Pipeline
Handles packaging and deploying generated applications to hosting providers.

- **Supported providers:** Vercel, Netlify, and Forge-managed infrastructure
- **One-Click Deploy:** Streamlined flow that handles build, environment setup, and DNS configuration automatically
- **Custom domains:** Users on Pro tier and above can connect their own domains
- **Preview deploys:** Every generation creates a temporary preview URL for testing

## Collaboration Layer
Team features that enable multi-user workflows.

- **Team workspaces:** Shared projects, role-based permissions (Owner, Editor, Viewer)
- **Shared component library:** Reusable components that team members can include in generations
- **Version history:** Full history of generations with diff view and rollback
- **Comments and feedback:** Inline commenting on generated outputs

## Admin Console
Management and configuration for Teams and Enterprise customers.

- **User management:** Invite, remove, and manage team member roles
- **Billing:** Subscription management, usage tracking, invoices
- **SSO:** SAML and OIDC integration for Enterprise customers
- **Audit logs:** Activity logging for compliance (Enterprise only)
- **Usage analytics:** Team-level generation volume, adoption metrics, cost tracking
