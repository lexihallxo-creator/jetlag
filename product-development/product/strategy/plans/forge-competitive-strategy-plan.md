# Write Forge Product Vision & Competitive Strategy Document

## Context
Leadership needs a comprehensive product vision and competitive strategy document that articulates why Forge is differentiated in the AI prototyping space, maps the competitive landscape, and makes the case for why Forge is uniquely positioned to win. The document will be used for exec reviews, board prep, and strategic planning.

## Output
Single markdown file: `product-development/product/strategy/vision/forge-competitive-strategy-2026.md`

## Temp folder
Agents write to `product-development/product/strategy/vision/.tmp/` during execution. Assembly pass merges into the final file and deletes the temp folder.

```
vision/.tmp/
├── agent1-vision-problem.md
├── agent2-competitors.md
├── agent3-features-pricing.md
└── agent4-customer-research.md
```

## Steps

### Step 1: Build shared context briefing
Read the following files and prepare a context block that will be passed to all 3 agents:
- `product-development/product/CLAUDE.md` (pillars, modules, terminology)
- `product-development/product/competitive-research/CLAUDE.md` (competitor list, positioning, key takeaways)
- `product-development/product/competitive-research/competitors/competitive-matrix.md` (feature comparison)
- `product-development/product/strategy/business-context/forge-business-info.md` (business metrics)

Condense into a briefing covering:
- What Forge is and its 5 pillars
- The 6 competitors and their positioning (1-2 sentences each)
- Forge's current state per pillar
- Key business metrics

### Step 2: Launch agents

**Dependency:** Agent 1 reads Agent 4's output for customer verbatims. Launch Agents 2, 3, and 4 in parallel first. Launch Agent 1 after Agent 4 completes.

```
Step 2a: Agents 2, 3, 4 in parallel
Step 2b: Agent 1 (after Agent 4 completes)
Step 3:  Assembly (after all agents complete)
```

#### Agent 1: Vision & Market Problem (Sections 1-3) [model: opus]

Prompt:

```
You are writing sections of a product vision and competitive strategy document for Forge, an AI prototyping platform.

WRITING GUIDE: Read `.claude-user/skills/writing-guide-strategy/SKILL.md` before writing anything. Follow the voice principles, argument construction pattern, and evidence toolkit exactly.

SHARED CONTEXT:
[Insert shared context briefing from Step 1]

SOURCE FILES TO READ:
- `product-development/product/strategy/vision/forge-platform-vision.md` — existing vision
- `product-development/product/strategy/business-context/forge-jtbd-and-users.md` — user personas and JTBD
- `product-development/product/strategy/vision/.tmp/agent4-customer-research.md` — customer research synthesis (from Agent 4, read after it completes)

WRITE THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS:

## Section 1: What's Broken in the Market Today

Organize around two themes:

**What's broken (5 structural failures):**
1. The stack is fragmented by design — AI prototyping tools cover one slice (frontend, or backend, or deployment) but none cover the full stack. Customers assemble 3-5 tools.
2. Prototype-to-production gap kills projects — most AI-generated code never ships. It's a demo, not an app. The export-to-IDE gap is where projects die.
3. Enterprise is locked out — no AI prototyping tool has SSO, audit logs, or compliance. Enterprise teams can't adopt.
4. Collaboration is an afterthought — most tools are single-player. Teams can't work together on generated projects.
5. Design quality vs engineering depth is a false tradeoff — tools are either beautiful but shallow (Lovable) or deep but ugly (Replit). Nobody does both.

**How this impacts customers (with verbatims):**
- Pull 2-3 real customer quotes from the call summaries
- Reference specific competitor limitations by name

## Section 2: Mission, Vision, and Why Forge Can Do Better

Three parts:
1. Mission/Vision/North Star — draft crisp, bold statements specific to Forge
2. Why Forge can do better — structural advantages (full-stack generation, one-click deploy, enterprise features, template marketplace)
3. The Five Pillars — brief overview referencing the pillar definitions from product/CLAUDE.md

## Section 3: Executive Summary

Write LAST (after reading Sections 4-8 from the other agents' output). Standalone 1-pager with:
- 2-sentence product thesis
- Pillar grid with status
- Competitive moat summary
- Key metrics
- Strategic kicker

OUTPUT: Write to `product-development/product/strategy/vision/.tmp/agent1-vision-problem.md`
```

- Note which prices are confirmed vs estimated
- Include a "customer savings" comparison: buying 3-4 separate tools vs Forge

OUTPUT: Write to `product-development/product/strategy/vision/.tmp/agent3-features-pricing.md`
```

#### Agent 4: Customer Research Synthesis (Section 9) [model: opus]

Prompt:

```
You are writing a customer research synthesis section for a product vision and competitive strategy document for Forge, an AI prototyping platform.

WRITING GUIDE: Read `.claude-user/skills/writing-guide-strategy/SKILL.md` before writing anything. Follow the voice principles, argument construction pattern, and evidence toolkit exactly.

SHARED CONTEXT:
[Insert shared context briefing from Step 1]

SOURCE FILES TO READ:
- `product-development/product/customers/CLAUDE.md` — customer segments and account routing
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/acme-corp/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/meridian-health/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/crestview-financial/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/stackline/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/axiom-logistics/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/helix-robotics/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/volta-energy/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/novabridge/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/pinnacle-media/account-context.md`
- `product-development/product/customers/accounts/*/calls/summaries/*.md` — all call summaries

WRITE THE FOLLOWING SECTION:

## Section 9: What Customers and Research Are Telling Us

Synthesize across all customer accounts and call summaries to surface:

**Common themes:**
- What are customers consistently asking for? Group requests into themes (e.g. "enterprise security," "deployment flexibility," "design quality").
- What pain points come up repeatedly across different accounts?

**Segment patterns:**
- How do Enterprise customer needs differ from Growth customer needs?
- What's blocking expansion in each segment?

**Key verbatims:**
- Pull the strongest 4-6 direct quotes from call summaries that illustrate the themes above
- Attribute each with name, title, and company
- Use pull-quote table format for the most compelling ones

**Feature demand signals:**
- Which features from the competitive matrix are customers explicitly requesting?
- Map customer requests to specific competitors they're comparing us to (e.g. "Stackline wants API access — evaluating Replit as alternative")

**Risk signals:**
- Which accounts have churn risk and why?
- What competitive threats are customers mentioning?

This section should give leadership a clear picture of what the market is telling us, grounded in specific customer evidence rather than assumptions.

OUTPUT: Write to `product-development/product/strategy/vision/.tmp/agent4-customer-research.md`
```

### Step 3: Assembly

After all 4 agents complete, the orchestrating agent:
1. Reads all 4 files from `product-development/product/strategy/vision/.tmp/`
2. Merges into `product-development/product/strategy/vision/forge-competitive-strategy-2026.md` with proper section numbering
3. Writes Section 3 (Executive Summary) — the orchestrator has the full document in context, so it can distill the 1-pager
4. Inserts exec summary at the top
5. Deletes `.tmp/` folder

### Step 4: Verification

- All 6 competitors appear in the landscape matrix
- Pricing data matches source files
- Customer quotes are attributed with name and company
- Exec summary stands alone without referencing other sections
- Voice matches the writing guide (no hedging, specific numbers, active voice)
- Read end-to-end for narrative flow
