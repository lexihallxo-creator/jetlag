# Business Opportunity

Custom domains transform Forge from a prototyping tool into a production deployment platform. Today, every deployed project lives on a `*.forgeapp.dev` subdomain, which signals "demo" to anyone who sees the URL. For users building client deliverables, launching MVPs, or shipping internal tools, a branded domain is non-negotiable.

**Professional presentation drives paid conversion.** Users on the Free tier prototype and experiment. The moment they want to share something externally -- with a client, an investor, a user base -- they need a real URL. Custom domains are a natural upgrade trigger to Forge Pro.

**Table stakes for business users.** In every Enterprise and Teams sales conversation, custom domains come up in the first call. Procurement teams will not approve a platform where customer-facing applications are served from a third-party subdomain. Without custom domains, Forge is excluded from production use cases entirely.

| Conversion lever | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| Free-to-Pro upgrade trigger | Users who deploy are 3.2x more likely to upgrade; custom domains add a second conversion moment |
| Teams/Enterprise deal velocity | Removes a top-3 procurement blocker, reducing average sales cycle by an estimated 2 weeks |
| Retention | Users with custom domains have a projected 25% lower churn rate (based on competitive benchmarking with Vercel/Netlify data) |

# Why Now

Custom domains is the **number one requested deployment feature** across all feedback channels:

- **Feature request volume:** 47 unique requests in the last 90 days (FORGE-980, FORGE-1012, FORGE-1044 and related threads).
- **Customer calls:** Mentioned unprompted in 8 of the last 12 Enterprise prospect calls.
- **Competitive pressure:** Vercel, Netlify, Render, and Railway all offer custom domains on their lowest paid tiers. Lovable launched custom domain support in February 2026. Forge is now the only major AI prototyping platform without it.
- **Revenue at risk:** Three active pipeline deals totaling ~$180K ARR have flagged custom domains as a requirement for signing.

# Customer Requests

| Source | Customer/Segment | Verbatim |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Feature request (FORGE-980) | Pro user, freelance developer | "I love building with Forge but I can't send clients a forgeapp.dev link. They'd never take it seriously." |
| Sales call, 2026-03-05 | Enterprise prospect, fintech | "We need our compliance portal on our own domain. If Forge can't do that, we'll have to look at alternatives." |
| Support ticket | Teams user, agency | "We're building client projects in Forge. Each one needs to live on the client's domain. This is a dealbreaker for us." |
| NPS comment | Pro user, startup founder | "Forge is amazing for prototyping. The second I want to go live, I have to move everything to Vercel for a real domain. Fix this and I'll never leave." |
| Customer call, 2026-02-28 | Enterprise pilot, healthcare | "Our legal team won't approve anything that doesn't run on our corporate domain. Period." |

# Goals

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| Enable professional deployments | Domain setup completion rate | > 75% of users who start the flow complete it |
| Fast time-to-live | Time from domain added to serving traffic | < 10 minutes (median) |
| Reliable SSL | SSL provision success rate | > 99% |
| Drive upgrades | Free-to-Pro conversion lift among deployers | +15% relative increase |
| Reduce churn | 90-day retention for users with custom domains vs. without | +10pp |

# User Stories

## Freelance Developer (Pro)

**As a** freelance developer building client projects in Forge, **I want to** connect my client's domain to the deployed project **so that** the deliverable looks professional and the client sees their own brand in the URL.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- I can add a custom domain from the project's deployment settings.
- I see clear DNS configuration instructions for my registrar.
- The domain is live with HTTPS within minutes of DNS propagation.
- I can remove the domain when the project is complete.

## Startup Founder (Pro)

**As a** startup founder who prototyped my MVP in Forge, **I want to** launch it on my own domain **so that** early users and investors see a legitimate product, not a demo link.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- I can add my startup's domain (e.g., `app.mystartup.com`) to my Forge project.
- SSL is provisioned automatically -- I don't need to manage certificates.
- The domain stays live and certificates auto-renew without my intervention.

## Agency Lead (Teams)

**As an** agency lead managing multiple client projects, **I want to** connect a different custom domain to each project **so that** each client gets a branded deployment without leaving Forge.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Each project in my Teams workspace can have its own custom domain.
- I can see the status of all domains across projects in one place.
- My team members can manage domains for projects they have access to.

## Enterprise Admin (Enterprise)

**As an** IT administrator at an enterprise customer, **I want to** deploy Forge-built internal tools on our corporate domain **so that** they comply with our security and branding policies.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Domains are verified through DNS to prove ownership.
- SSL certificates are issued from a trusted CA (Let's Encrypt).
- I can remove a domain and its certificate is revoked immediately.
- Audit logs capture domain add/remove/verify events.

# Launch Plan

## Phase 1: Internal Dogfood (Week 1-2)

- Deploy behind `custom-domains` feature flag.
- Forge team tests with internal projects and personal domains.
- Validate end-to-end flow: add domain, configure DNS, verify, SSL provision, serve traffic, remove.
- Fix any issues found before external exposure.

## Phase 2: Closed Beta (Week 3-4)

- Invite 50 Pro and Teams users who submitted feature requests.
- Track domain setup completion rate, time-to-live, and SSL success rate against targets.
- Gather qualitative feedback on DNS instructions (are they clear? do users need more registrar guides?).
- Iterate on UX based on where users drop off.

## Phase 3: General Availability (Week 5-6)

- Enable for all Pro, Teams, and Enterprise tiers.
- Publish help center article with video walkthrough.
- Add "Custom Domains" to the deployment settings page for all eligible users.
- Display upgrade CTA for Free-tier users.
- Announce in product changelog, in-app notification, and email to Pro/Teams users.
- Run targeted email to Enterprise pipeline deals that flagged custom domains.

## Success Criteria for GA

- Domain setup completion rate > 75%.
- Median time-to-live < 10 minutes.
- SSL provision success rate > 99%.
- Zero P0/P1 bugs from beta.
- Help center article published with registrar guides for GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Cloudflare.
