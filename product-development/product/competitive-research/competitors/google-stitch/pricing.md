## Pricing Model

Free product through Google Labs (experimental). No paid tiers currently announced. Usage is gated by monthly generation limits rather than by payment. This is consistent with Google's pattern of offering Labs products for free during beta to build adoption before monetizing.

## Tiers

| Tier | Price | Key Inclusions | Target User |
|------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Free (Beta) | $0 | AI UI prototyping, mobile and web app generation, HTML/CSS code export, Google ecosystem integration | Designers and developers exploring AI prototyping |

## Free Tier

Currently free through Google Labs with usage caps:

- **Included:** AI UI prototyping, mobile and web app generation, HTML/CSS code export, Google ecosystem integration (Firebase, Material Design)
- **Limits:** 350 generations/mo (standard mode), 200 generations/mo (Pro Screen mode which supports image references)
- **Upgrade triggers:** N/A -- no paid tier exists. Users who hit limits must wait for the monthly reset.

The generation limits are reasonable for casual exploration but insufficient for production use. Pro Screen mode's lower limit (200 vs 350) reflects its higher compute cost from processing image inputs.

## Enterprise

No enterprise tier currently available. Product is in beta/experimental phase under Google Labs.

- **Pricing model:** None announced
- **Minimum commitment:** N/A
- **Notable terms:** Given Google's enterprise distribution through Google Cloud and Workspace, enterprise pricing is likely once the product matures. Integration with Google Cloud's existing enterprise agreements (committed spend, EDAs) would be the natural path.

## Comparison to Forge

| Dimension | Google Stitch | Forge | Advantage |
|-----------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Entry price | $0 (free beta) | Free tier available, paid tiers for more | Stitch (no cost at all) |
| Per-seat cost | $0 | Per-seat pricing | Stitch (for now) |
| Free tier generosity | 350 generations/mo | More features at free tier | Depends on usage pattern |
| Enterprise flexibility | None (no enterprise tier) | SSO, audit logs, team mgmt, compliance | Forge |

**Summary:** Google Stitch is free, which undercuts all competitors on price. However, it is an experimental product with significant limitations compared to Forge's production-ready platform. No deployment pipeline, no team collaboration features, no enterprise capabilities (SSO, audit logs, etc.). Stitch generates prototype-quality UI code (HTML/CSS), not production-ready full-stack applications.

The primary risk is Google's distribution power. If Stitch is integrated into Google Cloud or Google Workspace, it could become a default tool for enterprises already in the Google ecosystem. Forge's advantages -- production-ready output, full-stack generation, one-click deployment, enterprise features, and platform maturity -- are the key differentiators that justify Forge's pricing against a free competitor.
